1) Start by copying the contents of this directory to your image creation working directory
2) Edit factory-setting to the release you are working on
   (you may make a subdirectory for different releases with a copy of factory-settings in each)
3) Look at the parameters for ./min-sd and ./cp-sd (they are the same)
4) Run ./min-sd being careful not to overwrite a device you like
5) Run ./cp-sd with the same parameters (up arrow is a nice way to do this)

I have run this on Ubuntu 16.04
